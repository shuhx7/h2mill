# h2mill
Hydrogen at &lt; $1/kg* — produced directly from grid potential with PEM co-processors.

About the Innovation

H2Mill introduces a breakthrough in hydrogen production by placing PEM electrolyzers inline between the grid and industrial loads. Unlike conventional systems that require extra electricity, our technology harvests grid potential that already flows to steel plants, cement kilns, fertilizer factories, refineries, and more. The result: pure hydrogen at costs below $1/kg* — with no additional grid demand.

Key Advantages
Economic Breakthrough
Hydrogen at < $1/kg — cost-competitive with fossil fuels and cheaper than SMR.

Technical Integration
PEM systems act as co-processors, generating H₂ without disrupting power flow to industrial loads.

Sustainability
Zero net increase in grid demand, massive CO₂ reduction, oxygen by-product utilization.

Applications
Steel
Hydrogen-based DRI, decarbonizing arc furnaces.

Cement
Clean kiln combustion with H₂ + O₂ co-feed.

Fertilizer
Green ammonia at parity with SMR-based hydrogen.

Refineries
Low-carbon hydrogen for hydrotreating & desulfurization.

Transport
Hydrogen fueling for heavy trucks, buses, and ships.

Energy Storage
Hydrogen as long-duration, grid-scale storage.
